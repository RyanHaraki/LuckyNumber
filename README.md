# LuckyNumber
The goal of the project was to create
        a very simple copy of a cryptocurrency or NFT that maintains a
        value-retaining aspect. In this case, the value is that only the numbers
        1-10,000 can be chosen and that each number can be owned by only one
        wallet. A wallet can only have one number at a time. There is also no
        "search" functionality for what numbers have been chosen in order to
        keep unpicked numbers a secret, hence making them seem "more" valuable.
